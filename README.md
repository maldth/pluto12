# pluto12: The compact and inexpensive mechanical macropad

The pluto12 is (as the name suggests) a small, 12-key macropad used to aid in everyday computing tasks with macros. Using the QMK firmware, it is endlessly customizable as well as being open-source!

This project is currently in development; initial alpha/beta releases are untested and only consist of Gerber files.
